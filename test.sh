echo "===== Troubleshooting Tips ====="
echo "1. If NS-3 can't find ctrl interface: Verify TAP interface was created with 'ip a'"
echo "2. If connection not established: Check 'sudo tcpdump -i ctrl -n port 6653'"
echo "3. If controller doesn't receive anything: Verify controller IP matches topology.cc"
echo "4. If still not working: Try rebooting the VM"
